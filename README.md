This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on basic applicant information. It uses a small sample dataset containing details like income, credit history, marital status, and employment type. The data is first cleaned and converted into numeric form, and then a Random Forest classifier is trained to learn patterns from past loan decisions. Once trained, the model can accurately predict loan approval for new applicants. This project demonstrates how machine learning can help automate decision-making in banks, making the loan approval process faster, more consistent, and easier to understand. It is designed using basic tools and simple code so that beginners and HR reviewers can easily follow and understand how the system works.
